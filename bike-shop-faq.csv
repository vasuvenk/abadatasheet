Am I supposed to ride my bike on the sidewalk?,Unless you are a child no. Bicycles follow the rules of the road - including lights and stop signs. Bike close to the shoulder in the direction of traffic and use hand signals. Cyclists are allowed full use of the lane. At night and at dawn and dusk use bike lights. White for the front red for the back (like a car). You are not as visible as you think you are even if your bike has reflectors.

How often do I need to lubricate my chain?,Again depends on how many miles you put on your bike in what conditions you usually ride and how well you do your own basic maintenance. If you ride in rainy wet road weather you could lube your chain everyday. If you can see it's dry if there's a bit of corrosion some stuck links or you hear an excessive mechanical sound chances are it could use a lube. Only use lubrication specially formulated for bicycle chains please!
How often should I get a tune-up?,Depends on how many miles you put on your bike in what conditions you usually ride and how well you do your own basic maintenance.

My bike was stolen what should I do?,Ugh! We seriously hate hearing this! Hopefully your bike was registered and you can report it stolen with the police. They really do a great job recovering stolen bikes that have been registered. If it wasn't we definitely recommend stopping by your local police station or we will register your bike at the shop for free and provide you with a license. Some people have had luck retrieving their stolen bikes by posting reward flyers or just by driving around town. Unfortunately bike theft is very common which is why at the very least we recommend a U-lock. Cable locks do not cut it in a city and we do not even stock them as an option in the store. Ask us how to properly lock up your bicycle to avoid theft!
What is your return policy?,Returns must be within 30 days of purchase with receipt and in original packaging. After 30 days store credit or exchange only. Used and consignment bike sales have a No refund or exchange policy. New bicycles are returnable for 30 days with original receipt. They must be unridden and in original and sellable condition. A 15% restocking fee of purchase total may be charged on all returns and any cancellations of special orders.
When can I drop off my bike for repair?,Drop your bike off for repair at any time during our open hours but keep in mind we may be busier during lunch or after work hours.

Send us an email if it's after hours and we will do our best to get back to you ASAP.
