  + JSON file will be downloaded to your computer that you will need in the setup sections below.

#### Bike Shop Calendar Setup

1. While still in Settings, scroll down and copy the **Calendar ID** in the **Integrate Calendar** section.

#### Add Service Account and Calendar ID to Fulfillment
1. Go to the `index.js` file in [Dialogflow's Fulfillment section](https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/#/agent//fulfillment)
1. Take the **Calendar ID** copied from the prior section and replace `<INSERT CALENDAR ID HERE>` on line 24 of `index.js`.
```js

const calendarId = '6ujc6j6rgfk02cp02vg6h38cs0@group.calendar.google.com';
```
1. Next copy the contents of the JSON file downloaded in the "Service Account Setup" section and paste it into the empty object on line 25 of `index.js` `const serviceAccount = {}`.
```js
//Ex:
    const serviceAccount = {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "bikesample",
    ...
  };
```

#### [OPTIONAL] Add Bike Shop FAQ Knowledge Connector
1. Open Dialogflow and go to **Settings (⚙) > General > Beta features** and click the switch to "Enable beta features and APIs" and then click "Save"
1. Click on the Knowledge tab in the left column and then "Create Knowledge base" in the top right.  Name the knowledge base `Bike Shop` and click "Save"
1. Next, click `Create the first one.` in the center of the screen to create your first knowledge document.  Enter in `Bike Shop FAQ` for the document name, `text/csv` for the "Mime Type" and `FAQ` for the "Knowledge type".
1.  Under "Data source" select `URL` and enter `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dialogflow/fulfillment-bike-shop-nodejs/master/bike-shop-faq.csv` and then click "Create".
1. After the knowledge document has been created in the response section click "Add response". In text response you should see `$Knowledge.Answer[1]`. Click "Save".
1. Try it out! In the simulator on the right enter `do you sell ebikes?`.  You should see the response from the CSV you just uploaded: "We sell Electric bikes. We also can outfit your existing bike with a retrofit Bionx electric wheel kit. We do not do gas powered conversions."

## Running the sample
1. In [Dialogflow's console](https://console.dialogflow.com), in the Dialogflow simulator on the right, query your Dialogflow agent with `My bike is broken` and respond to the questions your Dialogflow agent asks.   After getting the required information, an appointment will be added to the "Bike Shop Calendar" calendar.
